# FWC API Error Handling Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The script was failing with a `KeyError: 'features'` because the FWC API was returning an error response instead of the expected data structure.

## Root Cause
The FWC API service at `https://atoll.floridamarine.org/arcgis/rest/services/FWC_GIS/OpenData_HAB/MapServer/9/query` was returning:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 500,
    "message": "Service FWC_GIS/OpenData_HAB/MapServer not started",
    "details": []
  }
}
```

This indicates the ArcGIS service is currently down or not available.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `_find_hab_data_by_id()`
- Added validation to check if `fwc_data` exists and has a 'features' key
- Added proper error messages when data structure is unexpected
- Used `.get()` method for safer dictionary access

### 2. Improved API Response Validation in `fetch_fwc_data()`
- Added validation to ensure API response is a dictionary
- Added validation to ensure 'features' is a list
- Added specific error detection for API service errors
- Enhanced debugging output when API returns errors

### 3. Robust Fallback Mechanism in `run()`
- Improved error handling for both FWC API and cached data retrieval
- Added nested try-catch blocks to handle multiple failure scenarios
- Better logging of fallback decisions

## Code Changes

### `fetch_hab_data.py` - Line 354
```python
# Before
for feature in fwc_data['features']:

# After  
if not fwc_data or 'features' not in fwc_data:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  FWC data missing 'features' key or is empty. Data structure: {list(fwc_data.keys()) if fwc_data else 'None'}")
    return None

features = fwc_data.get('features', [])
if not features:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  No features found in FWC data for {sample_location}")
    return None

for feature in features:
```

### `fetch_hab_data.py` - Line 115
```python
# Added validation
if not isinstance(data, dict):
    print(f"‚ùå Unexpected API response type: {type(data)}")
    raise ValueError(f"API returned non-dict response: {type(data)}")

features = data.get('features', [])
if not isinstance(features, list):
    print(f"‚ùå Unexpected features type: {type(features)}")
    print(f"API response keys: {list(data.keys())}")
    raise ValueError(f"API returned non-list features: {type(features)}")

# Added error detection
if len(features) == 0:
    if 'error' in data:
        print(f"üîç Debug: API Error: {data['error']}")
        raise ValueError(f"FWC API service error: {data['error'].get('message', 'Unknown error')}")
```

## Result
The script now gracefully handles FWC API service outages by:
1. Detecting API errors and providing clear error messages
2. Falling back to cached data from Google Sheets when available
3. Using default safe status data as a final fallback
4. Continuing to process all beaches with appropriate status information

## Testing
The fix was verified with a test script that confirmed:
- API errors are properly detected and reported
- Fallback to default data works correctly
- Processing continues with default safe status for all locations

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the FWC API service status
2. Consider implementing alternative data sources
3. Set up alerts for when the API is down
4. Document the expected API response format for future reference
